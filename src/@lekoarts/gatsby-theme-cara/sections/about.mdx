### About Liteit
For 20 years Liteit have developed individuals and managers through self awarenes programs originated from Swedish military. Initially all excersises was based on pen and paper, but over time we have changed way of working by introducing digital, applications helping us progressing more effective. 

Coaching people have given us a broad experience in mentoring, personal development and feedback has showed us importance of continuity. We have combined humans need of forgetting things with applications helping us create a habit and a lasting change. We have tried and failed, tried again and failed and sometimes made a change and succed. There are a lot of things that can be done, but success many times depends on what you decide not to do, spend your time on money on.
