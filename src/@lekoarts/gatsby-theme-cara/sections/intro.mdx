# Liteit 

### Launch a new business can be challenging, but we have experience!
Coaching people have given us a broad experience in mentoring, personal development and feedback has showed us importance of continuity. We have combined humans need of forgetting things with digital tools helping us create a habit and a lasting change. We have tried and failed, tried again and failed and sometimes made a change and succed. There are a lot of things that can be done, but success many times depends on what you decide not to do, spend your time on money on.

### Got an idea?
We are eager to hear you out, listen in to your problem or findings based on your research or expertise. Liteit might be able to support with a smaller seed investment and advisor.
