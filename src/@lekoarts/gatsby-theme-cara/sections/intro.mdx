# Liteit develop leaders

For 20 years, Liteit AB have developed individuals and managers through self awarenes programs originated from Swedish military. Initially all excersises was based on pen and paper, but over time we have changed way of working by introducing digital alternatives, based on software helping us progressing more effective.

# Launch a new business can be challenging, but we have experience!
Coaching people have given us a broad experience in mentoring, personal development and feedback has showed us importance of continuity. We have combined humans need of forgetting things with digital tools helping us create a habit and a lasting change. We have tried and failed, tried again and failed and sometimes made a change and succed. There are a lot of things that can be done, but success many times depends on what you decide not to do, spend your time on money on.

# Got an idea that you want to develop?
We are eager to hear you out, listen in to your problem or findings based on your research or expertise. Liteit might be able to support with a smaller seed investment and advisor.
